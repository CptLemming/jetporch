* if a template expression has an error, we should see the error always - should it be an error like CommandFailed is?
* should the "On Task Failed" be smarter?  Probably!  give more info!
* a path that does not have 'groups/' gives an error about dynamic inventory when it is not dynamic
* write a method for finding paths relative to playbook root that takes a context and use it when loading vars_files paths (DO NOT CHDIR!)

* trello items +...
* on failure show the failure reason, make this required
* colorize output

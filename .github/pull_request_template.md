GitHub is only a read-only mirror for this project.  This means Jet does not accept pull requests through GitHub. Instead, we accept contributions using
emailed patches through SourceHut.

Once you learn how (it takes a few short minutes to set up), the contribution process is very easy and does not even require pushing a branch.
